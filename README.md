# Deep-Supervised-Hashing-for-Gait-Retrieval
The deep gait retrieval hashing (DGRH) model to address the gait retrieval problem for large-scale datasets. Our proposed method is based on a supervised hashing method with a deep convolutional network. We use the ability of the CNN to capture the semantic gait features for feature representation and learn the compact hash codes with the compatible hash function.
